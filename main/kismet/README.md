Here are the files used to and related to the docker build of kismet *with support for remote capture on the same machine* (in contrast to [kismet-server](../kismet-server).

This is especially useful for testing setups in which Kismet server shouhld run on the same machine as the capture device is and building kismet remote capture software is not feasable.
